# Flit-UI

## About

**Flit-UI** is a a foundational Web UI system which can be easily customized. It based on [flit](https://github.com/pucelle/flit) and [ff](https://github.com/pucelle/ff).

**Flit-UI** was heavily inspired from [MorningStar Design System](http://designsystem.morningstar.com/index.html) since I've worked there.


## Preview

A very simple [preview page](https://pucelle.github.io/flit/) is here, more resources will come in the future.


## Note

**Flit-UI** only works on modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
